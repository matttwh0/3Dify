HOW TO PASS STATE TO CHILD COMPONENT:
    - CREATE STATE IN PARENT COMPONENT 
    - CREATE A FUNCTION INSIDE PARENT THAT RETURNS THE STATE TO USE AS A TAG
    - PASS THAT VALUE IN THE PARENT STATES RETURN STATEMENT 
    - RECEIVE THE STATE AS A PROP VIA PARAMETER IN CHILD COMPONENT 
    - NOW YOU CAN CALL THAT STATE IN THE FUNCTION AND USE IT
