# Aztech
3D Modeling Application
Turn 360° videos into realistic, 3D-printable models in minutes.


## Overview
Aztech 3D Model Generator simplifies the process of creating 3D models from real-world objects using just a video. No more tedious photogrammetry setups or expensive 3D scanners. Simply upload a 360° video, and our backend will process it into a usable, downloadable 3D model.


## Tech Stack

### Frontend
- **React** — JavaScript library for building UI
- **Vite** — Lightning-fast build tool for modern web apps
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first CSS framework
- **JavaScript** — Core frontend scripting language
  
### Backend
- **Flask** — Lightweight Python web framework
  
### Cloud / Database
- **Firebase** — Authentication, storage, and hosting

## Features
- Upload 360° video of an object
- Automatically extract frames and generate 3D models via photogrammetry
- Preview and download 3D models (.obj/.stl)
- User accounts and model gallery (via Firebase)
- (Optional) Share models with other users
